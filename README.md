# Mr.Mine BOT - Ver 4.1

Welcome to my repository! I've been making a bot for Mr.Mine so that I cant pick up chests, fight monsters and sell ores while I'm out there doing other things!
I finally came up with a version that I can share with you guys.

1920x1080 resolution only supported for now.

# Installation
You need pip to run the bot (included in the last version of python).

1) Execute the file 'installer.py'
2) That's it! just run the 'BOT.py' file

Cheers!
