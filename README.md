# Mr.Mine BOT - Ver 4.1

Welcome to my repository! I've been making a bot for Mr.Mine so that I cant pick up chests, fight monsters and sell ores while I'm out there doing other things!
I finally came up with a version that I can share with you guys.

1920x1080 resolution only supported for now.

# Installation
You need pip to run the bot.

1) Execute the file 'installer.py'
2) That's it!

If you have any troubles not grabbing chests, not fighting monsters,etc. Solutions will be posted in the next days. (you have to change the pictures on /bin/pics

For any suggestion, bug or ideas DM me on discord: ElPeiretti#7260

Cheers!
